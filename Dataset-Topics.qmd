Comments

- Efficient data technique? What does that mean, exactly?

- I think you're going to have trouble getting enough information from this site to demonstrate challenging topics. Your project may fall a bit flat as a result. This only has points -- so you're limited to scoring at best, which isn't much depth. 

- This isn't exactly "public agency/nonprofit" data as I'd envisioned it. 

I would suggest choosing a different topic with data that's going to require more than a quick grab from the webpage and a bit of string separation to format. I just don't think you're going to get enough out of this to stay busy for an hour.
